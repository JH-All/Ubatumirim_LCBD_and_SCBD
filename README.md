## Abstract
<p align="justify"> 
The organization of fish communities into habitat use groups facilitates a replicable understanding of species distribution, owing to the distinctive characteristics and ecological roles these groups play. By partitioning beta diversity and assessing both the species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD) and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD), we can evaluate the ecological importance of each group and measure the uniqueness of each site. The objective of this study was to comprehend how different habitat groups within the marine fish assemblage of Ubatumirim Bay contribute to beta diversity and to correlate the uniqueness of each sampling site to their attributes, aiming a better comprehension on the habitat use groups importance and on the community composition variation inside the bay. We sampled ichthyofauna at six locations within the bay, employing a shrimp trawl net at varying depths. We categorized the 95 identified species into five distinct habitat groups: reef-associated, pelagic-neritic, demersal, benthopelagic, and pelagic-oceanic, each with different ecological characteristics and preferences. However, no significant differences were detected in SCBD among these groups. An increase in LCBD values was observed with the decrease in mean sediment diameter (phi), indicating a higher environmental complexity, possibly acting as an environmental filter. One of the sampled sites, Couves Island, stood out with a significantly higher LCBD value, which underscores the importance of such diverse environments in maintaining regional biodiversity. These findings can serve as a valuable baseline reference in conservation planning and management, particularly in assessing the effectiveness of the recently established Marine Environment Protection Area. For instance, comparing the current observations with future surveys could quantify the impact of this protection initiative, thus providing evidence of management efficacy and revealing the potential effects of impacts such as predatory tourism in the Ubatumirim Bay area.
