## Abstract
<p align="justify"> 
Dividing a community into groups enables us to better understand how species are distributed in a more replicable way, but it is also important to quantify how significant those groups and species are. Partitioning beta diversity makes this possible, through measuring the species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD) and the local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD), making it viable to not only investigate species importance to the environment, but as well to measure the degree of uniqueness for each site. For this reason, we calculated the LCBD and SCBD values related to the marine fish assemblage of Ubatumirim Bay, aiming to understand how different habitat groups contribute to beta diversity and to relate the uniqueness of each sampling site to their characteristics. The ichthyofauna was sampled using a shrimp trawl, at six points of different depths. The 95 species were classified into five habitat groups, but there was no significant difference of SCBD between groups. Meanwhile, Couves Island presented a higher local contribution to beta diversity when compared to the other sampled sites, and a beta regression found a significant relation of LCBD values with the decrease of the mean sediment diameter. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the patterns for SCBD were similar to those in the literature. Overall, we noticed that Couves Island harbors a unique composition of fishes, probably holding a greater environmental complexity, acting as an environmental filter. The presented diversity profile work as a conservation tool, supporting the management and allowing future testing of the effectiveness of the Marine Environmental Protection Area.
